## About SBGrid
### Research computing support for Structural Biologists
We support structural biologists by providing structural biology laboratories with a tested and refined software infrastructure that includes a large library of scientific applications. Members also benefit from access to SBGrid-supported high performance computing (HPC) resources and training opportunities.

The SBGrid Consortium is a non-profit, NIH-compliant Service Center that operates out of Harvard Medical School. We view the Consortium as a user-supported and user-directed community resource and rely on annual membership fees to support our community operation. Please visit our 'Join Us' page to request a membership packet and a detailed quote (when the network is back online).

Please don't forget to cite the software tools that you rely on for your research - including SBGrid (see our eLife paper). We are actively applying for grant support to improve SBGrid and your acknowledgement directly helps this effort.
